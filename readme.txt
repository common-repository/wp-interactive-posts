What is Google+ Interactive Sharing?

Interactive posts provide an easy and eye catching way to allow visitors on your site to share your site or app with their Google+ circles  Interactive posts can drive new users to your site, improve conversions, and increase engagement.

An interactive post in the Google+ stream is similar to a basic shared post but adds a call-to-action button and support for deep linking.
